# Perilous Framework
An open source Swift framework using WKWebView to convert websites to native WebView apps. I created this framework to help those new to swift create WebView apps easier as I couldn't find a well  documented tutorial online. This software is open source and free for use. Please credit me in your work if you decide to clone/fork this project. Thank you and enjoy!

# How to use:
## 1. Enter your website url into "ViewController.swift"

## 5. Build the app in Xcode by clicking build

<br />
<br />

## 6. Your app should be located under this directory in Finder:
<br />
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/{your app}/Build/Products/Debug/{Project Name}.app
<br />
<br />
(If your having issues try quiting the app. Xcode autoruns it on build. Then you can copy/paste it to a better location in Finder.)
